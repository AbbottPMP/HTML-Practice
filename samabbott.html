        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>My name is Sam Abbott and I am an Air Force Veteran who currently works in Project Management for CarMax. The emerging focus on Tech, 
            including the ability to code, is present everywhere. I started researching coding to better understand it, and potentially learn 
            to code at a basic level. I believe an intro to coding will help me determine whether I am interested in futhering my coding 
            ability, choosing the learning format that may work best for me, and determining if I am ready to commit to a formal code-learning 
            program.

        <h1>HTML & CSS Languages</h1>
        This is practice using introducty front-end coding languages Hyper Text Markup Language (HTML) and Cascading Style Sheets (CSS). HTML 
        is used to determine what information is on a webpage and CSS is used to style the information with color, background, font settings, 
        etc. </p>
